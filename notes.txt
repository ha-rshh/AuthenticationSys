FullStack App Speedrun

npm init
node install express
create index.js file
create .env file

use import as its modern practice


## we have 65535 ports in computer few common ports are 4000, 808, 5000
use can use any

type of request are GET, POST, PUT, DELTE

web server is an infinite loop
it keeps on running i.e. listen 

sending get request is easy --> 127.0.0.1:3000 or locahost:3000 then use slash / to send the type of request 


to keep monitoring the changes we use node monitor (nodemon)
use npm i nodemon to install node monitor

point to remember--
we have two type of dependencies one is for production and one is for development
that we don't use in production, so basically nodemon is type of development dependency 
use -D to intall package in development dependency


change the script in package.json to let the nodemon know which file needs to be monitored
ex:  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js",
    } 
    or you can do it in diff way as well ie.

    "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    } 

Routes will always start from / , you cannot write like this app.get(harsh)
always write app.get("/harsh", (res, req))
